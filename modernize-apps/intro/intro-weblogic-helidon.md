# Introduction

## About this Workshop
This workshop delves into the seamless integration of Helidon Microservice, a lightweight Java microservices framework, with Oracle WebLogic Server, a robust Java EE application server.

Throughout this workshop, we’ll focus on the practical demonstration of integrating the BestBank application, developed using Java EE, with Helidon MP.

By developing a new service for the BestBank application using Helidon MP, we’ll showcase the smooth interoperability between Java EE and Helidon MP, highlighting the potential for leveraging modern microservices architecture within traditional enterprise environments.


*Estimated Lab Time:* 90 minutes

### About Oracle WebLogic
Oracle WebLogic Server provides a modern development platform for building applications, a runtime platform for high performance and availability, and rich management tooling for efficient and low cost operations.

The complete implementation of the WebLogic Server, of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 8 (Java EE 8) specification provides a standard set of APIs for creating distributed Java applications that can access a wide variety of services, such as databases, messaging services, and connections to external enterprise systems. End-user clients access these applications using web browser clients or Java clients. See Programming Models.

In addition to the Java EE implementation, WebLogic Server enables enterprises to deploy mission-critical applications in a robust, secure, highly available, and scalable environment. These features allow enterprises to configure clusters of WebLogic Server instances to distribute load, and provide extra capacity in case of hardware or other failures. New diagnostic tools allow system administrators to monitor and tune the performance of deployed applications and the WebLogic Server environment itself. You can also configure WebLogic Server to monitor and tune application throughput automatically without human intervention. Extensive security features protect access to services, keep enterprise data secure, and prevent malicious attacks.

### About Oracle Helidon MP

Helidon MP is an Eclipse MicroProfile 6.1 runtime that allows the Jakarta EE community to run microservices in a portable way. It is designed for ease of use and provides Spring Boot like development experience with heavy usage of dependency injection and annotations.

Even though Helidon MP supports Jakarta EE APIs it does not require an application server. Helidon MP applications are stand-alone Java applications running in their own JVM powered by Helidon WebServer. So you get all the benefits of a low overhead server built on Java virtual threads

### Objectives
* To seamlessly integrate an application running on WebLogic  with a Helidon MP microservice
* Build a Helidon MP Microservice using Maven Archetype for Helidon
* Add Cache with Coherence CE
* Extend WebLogic application to use Helidon Microservice
