# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Deploying a Tomcat application on a Kubernetes cluster can be a complex process that involves managing multiple containers, configuring networking, and ensuring high availability and scalability. To simplify this process, many organizations are turning to containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes.

Docker allows for the creation of portable container images that can be deployed on any platform, while Kubernetes provides a powerful orchestration engine that can manage the deployment and scaling of containers.

Oracle Verrazzano is a cloud-native platform that provides a unified management experience for deploying and operating containerized applications on Kubernetes clusters. It simplifies the deployment of complex applications by providing a consistent set of tools and APIs that can be used to manage and monitor applications across multiple clusters.

In this workshop, we will explore the process of deploying a Tomcat application Docker image to an Oracle Kubernetes cluster using Verrazzano. We will cover the steps involved in creating a Docker image, configuring Verrazzano, deploying the application, and monitoring its performance. 

By the end of this workshop, you will have a clear understanding of how to deploy containerized applications on an Oracle Kubernetes cluster using Verrazzano.

This workshop is designed to be as self-explanatory as possible, but feel free to ask for clarification or assistance along the way.

Estimated Time: 90 minutes
