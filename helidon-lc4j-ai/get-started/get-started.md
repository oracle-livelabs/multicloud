# Get Started

## Introduction

This lab provides you with two options that you may follow to complete the lab.

Estimated time: 02 minutes

### Objectives

* Select your environment


## Task 1: Select your environment

We provide you with two options for completing the workshop, allowing you to choose the method that best suits your needs.

**Run the Workshop in Your Own Environment:** If you prefer, you can set up the workshop in your personal environment. This allows you to work in a familiar setup, using your own tools and configurations. In this case, you need to start with **Lab 1A** and skip **Lab 1B**.

**Run the Workshop in a Remote Desktop:** Alternatively, we have a prepared remote desktop environment for you. This option offers a ready-to-use workspace, designed specifically for the workshop. In this case, you need to start with **Lab 1B** and skip **Lab 1A**. 

Please note that the remote desktop will be destroyed after this session, so any work or data saved will not persist beyond the session.

Choose the option that works best for you, and get started with the workshop!

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
