    > Please ignore the warnings/problems, you notice in Code Editor while opening this folder.


3. Open a new terminal, and then copy and paste the following command to set the PATH and JAVA_HOME variable.
    ```bash
    <copy>PATH=~/jdk-21.0.2/bin:~/apache-maven-3.8.3/bin:$PATH
    JAVA_HOME=~/jdk-21.0.2/</copy>
    ```

4. Copy the following command and run in the terminal to verify that required JDK and Maven version are configured properly.

    ```bash
    <copy>mvn -v</copy>
    ```

    you will have the output similar to the following:
    ```bash
    $ mvn -v
    Apache Maven 3.8.3 (ff8e977a158738155dc465c6a97ffaf31982d739)

    $  
    ```

    > *You will use only this terminal for building and running the application as it has the required JDK and Maven version.*

5. Copy and paste the following command to build the blocking application.
    ```bash
    <copy>cd ~/helidon-virtual-thread/blocking/
    mvn clean package -DskipTests</copy>
    ```

    ```

7. Write down the port number on which the server runs (see the log entry for @default). For example, in our output, the port number is 44963. Similarly, find out your server port number.

8. To open new terminal, click *Terminal* -> *New Terminal*. We will use this terminal to run *curl* commands. 
    ![New Terminal](images/new-terminal.png)
    

9. Copy and paste the following command into the new terminal. Don't forget to replace *`<port>`* with your server port.
    ```bash
    <copy>curl http://localhost:<port>/one</copy>
    ```
    You will have output similar to the following:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:44963/one
    remote_1
    $
    ```

10. Copy and paste the following command into the new terminal. Don't forget to replace to *`<port>`* with your server port.
    ```bash
    <copy>curl http://localhost:<port>/sequence</copy>
    ```
    You will have output similar to the following:
    ```bash
    $ curl http://localhost:44963/sequence
    Combined results: [remote_2, remote_3, remote_4, remote_5, remote_6, remote_7, remote_8, remote_9, remote_10, remote_11]
    $
    ```
    > Notice the order of the results. As suggested by the name, this request invokes a remote resource multiple times in sequence.


11. Copy and paste the following command into the new terminal. Don't forget to replace to *`<port>`* with your server port.
    ```bash
    <copy>curl http://localhost:<port>/parallel</copy>
    ```
    You will have output similar to the following:
    ```bash
    $ curl http://localhost:44963/parallel
    Combined results: [remote_21, remote_18, remote_12, remote_13, remote_14, remote_15, remote_16, remote_17, remote_19, remote_20]
    $
    ``` 
    > Notice the order of the results. As suggested by the name, this request invokes a remote resource multiple times in parallel.

12. Press the *Ctrl + C* in the terminal where *java -jar * command is running to to stop the server.

## Task 2: Build and Run the Reactive application

1. Copy and paste the following command to build the reactive application.
    ```bash
    <copy>cd ~/helidon-virtual-thread/reactive/
    mvn clean package -DskipTests</copy>

    <copy>curl http://localhost:<port>/one</copy>
    ```
    You will have output similar to the following:
    ```bash
    $ curl http://localhost:42095/one
    remote_1
    $
    ```

6. Copy and paste the following command into the new terminal. Don't forget to replace to *`<port>`* with your server port.
    ```bash
    <copy>curl http://localhost:<port>/sequence</copy>
    ```
    You will have output similar to the following:
    ```bash
    $ curl http://localhost:42095/sequence

    <copy>curl http://localhost:<port>/parallel</copy>
    ```
    You will have output similar to the following:
    ```bash
    $ curl http://localhost:42095/parallel
    Combined results: [remote_17, remote_16, remote_13, remote_20, remote_12, remote_19, remote_18, remote_14, remote_21, remote_15]
    $
    ``` 
    > Notice the order of the results. As suggested by the name, this request invokes a remote resource multiple times in parallel.

8. Press the *Ctrl + C* in the terminal where *java -jar * command is running to to stop the server.

## Task 3: Analyse the simplicity of the Blocking application

**Blocking vs. Reactive**

Letâ€™s compare the implementations between blocking and Helidon SE (reactive) for the same task.

* Both implementations execute REST calls using the Helidon WebClient
* The blocking implementation is straightforward to follow:
    - The execution flow is reflected by the statement order in the code
    - There are no calls to intricate or semantically-rich library calls
    - Debugging is straightforward
* Reactive versions require a good understanding of reactive libraries
    - Including Multi, flatMap, error handling, etc.
    - Control flow is no longer obvious due to use of reactive handlers
    - An understanding of flatMap's capability to enable/forbid concurrency is required
    - Debugging is more difficult


1. Open the *blocking/src/main/java/io/examples/helidon/blocking/BlockingService.java* file to see how endpoints are implemented in the blocking version of the application.
    ![Blocking Block](images/nima-block.png)

2. Open the *reactive/src/main/java/io/examples/helidon/reactive/ReactiveService.java* file to see how endpoints are implemented in the reactive version of the application.
    ![Reactive Service](images/reactive-service.png)

3. In *OPEN EDITORS* section, right click on the *BlockingService.java* file and select the *Select for Compare*.
    ![Select Compare](images/select-compare.png)

4. Right click on the *ReactiveService.java* file and select the *Compare with Selected*.
    ![Compare selected](images/compare-selected.png)


5. See that reactive code is more complicated than blocking (Virtual Thread)
    ![Compare code](images/compare-code.png)

    > Check methods one, sequence and parallel in BlockingService and ReactiveService respectively. See if you understand how they work!

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
