# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop walks through the "Coherence Demonstration Application", which is a fictitious stock application, 
which demonstrates general Coherence features, scalability capabilities including:

* Clustering and Data Sharding
* Scalability and High Availability
* Disk-Based Persistence
* Parallel Queries
* Efficient Aggregation
* In-Place Processing
* Federation (Grid Edition feature only)
* OpenTracing Support
* Polyglot client access from JavaScript, Python and Golang
* Listening for events using Server Sent Events (SSE)

Estimated time: 60 minutes


### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

* Run the Coherence Demonstration application showing various Coherence features
* Replicate data between multiple clusters using Federation
* Access the application via JavaScript, Python and Go clients
* Use OpenTracing to gain insight into a Coherence cluster from the API down to the Database
* Persist and recover cache data from disk

### Prerequisites
     
This lab assumes you have:

*  An Oracle Cloud Account - Please view this workshop's LiveLabs landing page to see which environments are supported
