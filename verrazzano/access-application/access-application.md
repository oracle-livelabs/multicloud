# Access the Bobby's Books sample application Explore Verrazzano, Grafana and Kiali Console

## Introduction

In Lab 3, we deployed the Bobby's Book application. In this lab, we will access the application and verify that it is working. Later, we will explore the Verrazzano and Grafana consoles.

Estimated time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Access the Bobby's Book application.
* Explore the Verrazzano console.
* Explore the Grafana console.

### Prerequisites

<if type="freetier">
* Run Lab 1, which creates an OKE cluster on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
</if>

<if type="livelabs">
* Run Lab 1, which configure kubectl to access an OKE cluster on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
</if>

* Run Lab 2, which installs Verrazzano on a Kubernetes cluster.
* Run Lab 3, which deploys the Bobby's Book application.
* You should have a text editor, where you can paste the commands and URLs and modify them, as per your environment. Then you can copy and paste the modified commands for running them in the *Cloud Shell*.
* We recommend to use Firefox for opening the URLs of Bobby's Books application, Verrazano, Grafana and Kiali Console. However, if you want to use Chrome, then you need to use the undocumented 'thisisunsafe' workaround to allow chrome to accept the cert.

## Task 1: Access the Bobby's Book application

1. We need an `EXTERNAL_IP` address through which we can access the Bobby's Book application. To get the `EXTERNAL_IP` address of the istio-ingressgateway service, copy the following command and paste it in the *Cloud Shell*.

      ```bash
      <copy> kubectl get service \
      -n "istio-system" "istio-ingressgateway" \
      -o jsonpath={.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}; echo</copy>
      ```

   The output should be similar to the following:
      ```bash
         $ kubectl get service \
         > -n "istio-system" "istio-ingressgateway" \
         > -o jsonpath={.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}; echo
         XX.XX.XX.XX
      ```
2. To open the Robert's Book Store Home Page, copy the following URL and replace *XX.XX.XX.XX* with your *EXTERNAL_IP* address which we got in the last step, as shown in the following image.

      ```bash
      <copy>https://bobs-books.bobs-books.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io/</copy>
      ```

   ![Roberts Books Page](images/robertbooks.png " ")

3. Click *Advanced*, as shown:

   ![Robert Advanced](images/robertadvanced.png " ")


4. Select *Proceed to bobs-books.bobs-books. EXTERNAL_IP .nip.io(unsafe)* to access the application. If you are the not getting this option for proceed, just type *thisisunsafe* without any space anywhere inside this chrome browser window. As you are typing in the chrome browser window, you can't see it, but as soon as you finish typing *thisisunsafe*, you can see application page immediately. You can find more details [here](https://verrazzano.io/latest/docs/faq/faq/#enable-google-chrome-to-accept-self-signed-verrazzano-certificates).

   ![Robert Page](images/robertpage.png " ")

5. To open the Bobby's Book Store Home page, open a new tab and copy the following URL and replace *XX.XX.XX.XX* with your `EXTERNAL_IP` address, as shown in the following image.

      ```bash
      <copy>https://bobs-books.bobs-books.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io/bobbys-front-end/</copy>
      ```

      ![Bobbys URL](images/bobbysurl.png " ")

      ![Bobby bookstore](images/bobbysbookstore.png " ")

      > Leave this page open  because we will use it in Lab 8.

6. To open the Bobby's Book Order Manager UI, open a new tab and copy the following URL and replace *XX.XX.XX.XX* with your *EXTERNAL_IP* address as shown in the following image.

      ```bash
      <copy>https://bobs-books.bobs-books.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io/bobs-bookstore-order-manager/orders</copy>
      ```

   ![order manager](images/ordermanager.png " ")

7. Go Back to the *Bobby's Books* page and let's purchase a book. Click *Books* as shown in the following image.

   ![Check out order](images/checkoutorder.png " ")

8. Select the image for the *Twilight* Book, as shown in the following image.

   ![Purchase book](images/purchasebook.png " ")

9. First, click *Add to cart* and then *Checkout* as shown in the following image.

   ![Click addcart](images/clickaddcart.png " ")

10. Enter the details for purchasing the book. For *Your State*, enter your two digit state code and then click *Submit Order*.

   ![Submit Order](images/submitorder.png " ")
11. Go back to the *Order Manager* page and select the *Refresh* button to check if your order is successfully recorded in the order manager.

   ![Verify Order](images/verifyorder.png " ")

## Task 2: Explore the Rancher Console

Verrazzano installs several consoles. The endpoints for an installation are stored in the `Status` field of the installed Verrazzano Custom Resource.

1. You can get the endpoints for these consoles by using the following command:

      ```bash
      <copy>kubectl get vz -o jsonpath="{.items[].status.instance}" | jq .</copy>
      ```

   The output should be similar to the following:
      ```bash
      $ kubectl get vz -o jsonpath="{.items[].status.instance}" | jq .
      {
      "consoleUrl": "https://verrazzano.default.xx.xx.xx.xx.nip.io",
      "grafanaUrl": "https://grafana.vmi.system.default.xx.xx.xx.xx.nip.io",
      "keyCloakUrl": "https://keycloak.default.xx.xx.xx.xx.nip.io",
      "kialiUrl": "https://kiali.vmi.system.default.xx.xx.xx.xx.nip.io",
      "openSearchDashboardsUrl": "https://kibana.vmi.system.default.xx.xx.xx.xx.nip.io",
      "openSearchUrl": "https://elasticsearch.vmi.system.default.xx.xx.xx.xx.nip.io",
      "prometheusUrl": "https://prometheus.vmi.system.default.xx.xx.xx.xx.nip.io",
      "rancherUrl": "https://rancher.default.xx.xx.xx.xx.nip.io"
      }
      $
      ```


2. Use the `https://rancher.default.YOUR_UNIQUE_IP.nip.io` to open the Rancher console.

3. Verrazzano *dev* profile use self-signed certificates, so you need to click **Advanced** to accept risk and skip the warning.

      ![Advanced](images/rancher-advanced.png)

4. Click **Proceed to rancher default XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io(unsafe)**. If you are not getting this option for proceeding, just type *thisisunsafe* without any space anywhere inside this chrome browser window. As you are typing in the chrome browser window, you can't see it, but as soon as you finish typing *thisisunsafe*, you can see the next page immediately. You can find more details [here](https://verrazzano.io/latest/docs/faq/faq/#enable-google-chrome-to-accept-self-signed-verrazzano-certificates).

      ![Proceed](images/rancher-proceed.png)

5. Click *Log in with Keycloak*.
      ![Rancher login](images/keycloak-login.png)

6. Because it redirects to the Keycloak console URL for authentication, click **Advanced**.

      ![Keycloak Authentication](images/keycloak-advanced.png)

7. Click **Proceed to Keycloak default XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io(unsafe)**. If you are not getting this option for proceeding, just type *thisisunsafe* without any space anywhere inside this chrome browser window. As you are typing in the chrome browser window, you can't see it, but as soon as you finish typing *thisisunsafe*, you can see the next page immediately. You can find more details [here](https://verrazzano.io/latest/docs/faq/faq/#enable-google-chrome-to-accept-self-signed-verrazzano-certificates).

      ![Proceed](images/keycloak-proceed.png)

8. Now we need the username and password for the Verrazzano console. *Username* is *verrazzano* and to find out the password, go back to the *Cloud Shell* and paste the following command to find out the password for the *Rancher Console*.

      ```bash
      <copy>kubectl get secret --namespace verrazzano-system verrazzano -o jsonpath={.data.password} | base64 --decode; echo</copy>
      ```

9. Copy the password and go back to the browser, where the *Rancher Console* is open. Paste the password in the *Password* field and enter *verrazzano* as *Username* and then click **Sign In**.
