# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This lab shows you how to install the Verrazzano platform on a single Kubernetes cluster and deploy a sample application using Verrazzano concepts.

The [Bobby’s Books](https://verrazzano.io/docs/samples/bobs-books/) sample application consists of three main parts:

- A back-end “order processing” application, which is a Java EE application with REST services and a very simple JSP UI, which stores data in a MySQL database. This application runs on WebLogic Server.
- A front-end web store “Robert’s Books”, which is a general book seller. This is implemented as a Helidon microservice, which gets book data from Coherence, uses a Coherence cache store to persist data for the order manager, and has a React web UI.
- A front-end web store “Bobby’s Books”, which is a specialty children’s book store. This is implemented as a Helidon microservice, which gets book data from a (different) Coherence cache store, interfaces directly with the order manager, and has a JSF web UI running on WebLogic Server.

### About Product/Technology

Verrazzano is an end-to-end enterprise container platform for deploying cloud-native and traditional applications in multicloud and hybrid environments. It is made up of a curated set of open source components – many that you may already use and trust, and some that were written specifically to pull together all of the pieces that make Verrazzano a cohesive and easy to use platform.
