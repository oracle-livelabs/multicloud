# Create an Auxiliary Image and Push it into the Oracle Container Image Registry

## Introduction

**Primary Image** - The image containing the Oracle Fusion Middleware software. It is used as the basis of all containers that run WebLogic Servers for the domain.

**Auxiliary Image** - The image that supplies the WebLogic Deploy Tooling software and the model files. At runtime, the auxiliary image’s content is merged with the primary image’s content.

In this Lab, we use the WebLogic server **12.2.1.4-slim-ol8** image as the Primary Image. Also, we create an auxiliary image and push it to the Oracle Container Image Registry repository using the pre-generated authentication token. 

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create an Auxiliary Image and push the image to Oracle Cloud Container Image Registry.

## Task 1: Prepare the Auxiliary Image and Push the Auxiliary Image  

In this task, we are creating an Auxiliary image, which we will push to the Oracle Cloud Container Registry.

1. Click **Image**. For the Primary Image, we will use the below **weblogic Image**. So leave default values under the **Primary Image** section as shown 

 ```bash
    <copy>container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4-slim-ol8</copy>
 ```

    > **For your information only:**<br>
    > The primary image is the one used for running the domain. One primary image can be reused for hundreds of domains. The primary image contains the OS, JDK, and FMW software installations.

2. Click **Auxiliary Image** tab in Image section. To create the **Auxiliary Image Tag**, we need the following information:

    * Endpoint for the Region
    * Tenancy Namespace
    * OCIR Registry Name

    > We have prefilled the values for you. You need to replace **tag** with your username. For example, user1/user2.

    > **For your information only:**<br>
    > An auxiliary image is domain-specific. The auxiliary image contains the data that defines the domain.

11. Click **Push Auxiliary Image** to push the image in the repository inside your Oracle Cloud Container Image Registry.
