# Make a upgrade in WebLogic Server Version (Optional) 

## Introduction

In this lab, we modify the primary image, we use WebLogic Server Image with *12.2.1.4-slim-ol8* tag. Then we re-deploy the domain using WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit UI. At last, we verify that newly managed server pods are using the updated WebLogic Server images through WebLogic Remote Console.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

## Task 2: Update a deployed application by a rolling restart of the server pods

In this task, we re-deploy the WebLogic Domain. Later, we use the WebLogic Remote Console, to verify that server pods are using the updated WebLogic Server 12.2.1.4.0 Image.

1. Click *Deploy Domain*. This will re-deploy the domain.

    > **For your information only:**<br>
    > As we changed our primary image, so we will notice rolling restart of the servers one by one. As you click on *Deploy Domain*, it start an *Introspector job*, which terminates the running admin server pods, and creates a new pod for admin server which uses WebLogic Server 12.2.1.4.0 image. Introspector do the same process with both the managed servers.

2. Once you see *WebLogic Domain Deployment to Kubernetes Complete* window, Click *Ok*.

    ```bash
    <copy>kubectl get pods -n test-domain-ns -w</copy>
    ```
