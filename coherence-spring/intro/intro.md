# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop introduces you to working with Coherence and Spring, and covers the following topics:

* An overview of Coherence Spring Boot Integration
* Quickstart Demo using [Cache Abstraction](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache.html) for result caching
* Provides hands-on experience working with Cache Events, Coherence Spring Data and Coherence Spring Session

Coherence Spring features dedicated support to bootstrap Oracle Coherence and to inject Coherence resources into Spring beans 
as well as to inject Spring beans into Coherence resources. 

Springâ€™s dependency injection (DI) support simplifies application code as Oracle Coherence maps, caches and topics are just injected instead 
of being obtained explicitly via Coherence APIs. 

Furthermore, using annotated event listener methods simplifies building reactive code that responds to Coherence cache events.

Estimated time: 90 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
    
* Run the Quickstart using Cache Abstraction 
* Use Coherence in Spring Boot applications
* Add Coherence event listeners
* Work with Spring Data and Spring Session
* Use VisualVM and the Coherence VisualVM plugin to view cache information

### Prerequisites
     
This lab assumes you have the following:

*  An Oracle Cloud Account - Please view this workshop's LiveLabs landing page to see which environments are supported
