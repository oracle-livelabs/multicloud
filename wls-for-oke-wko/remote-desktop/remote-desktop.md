# Set up compute instance

## Introduction

This lab will show you how to set up a **Oracle WebLogic Suite for OKE BYOL** stack that will generate the Oracle Cloud objects needed to run your workshop.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Generate an authentication token.
* Create a secret in a Vault
* Create a Stack: Oracle WebLogic Suite for OKE BYOL
* Connect to compute instance

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle Cloud account
* You have generated the pair of SSH keys.
* You have completed: **Lab: Prepare Setup**

## Task 1: Generate an Authentication Token 

In this task, we will generate an *Authentication Token*. In lab 5, we will use this authentication token to push auxiliary image into the Oracle Cloud Container Registry Repository. Also, we use this authentication token to pull WebLogic docker images to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry (also known as Container Registry). 

1. Select the User Icon in the top right corner and then select *MyProfile*.

2. Scroll down and select *Auth Tokens* and then click *Generate Token*.

3. Copy *`test-model-your_first_name`* and paste it in the *Description* box and click *Generate Token*.

4. Select *Copy* under Generated Token and paste it in your text file. We cannot copy it later. Click *Close*.

    > In the next task, we will store this authentication token in **Secret**.

## Task 2: Create a secret in a vault 

Secrets are credentials such as passwords, certificates, SSH keys, or **authentication tokens** that you use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services. 

1. In OCI Console, Click **Hamburger menu** -> **Identity & Security** -> **Vault**.
    ![menu vault](images/menu-vault.png)

2. Select the compartment under **List scope** and then click **Create Vault**.

3. Enter the name of the Vault and click **Create Vault**.
    ![create vault](images/create-vault.png)

4. Once you see the Vault you created is in **Active** State, Click on the Vault name as shown below.
    ![vault name](images/vault-name.png)

5. Inside the vault, click **Master Encryption Keys** and then click **Create Key**.
    ![menu mek](images/menu-mek.png)

6. Enter the name for the **key** and then click **Create Key** as shown below.
    ![create mek](images/create-mek.png)

7. Once you see the state for new Master Encryption key change to **Enabled** then click **Secrets** under **Resources** as shown below.
    ![menu secrets](images/menu-secret.png)

8. Click **Create Secret**.

9. Enter the name for Secret and choose the new Encryption key and enter the authentication token as **Secret Contents** as shown below. Click **Create Secret**.

## Task 3: Create Stack: Oracle WebLogic Suite for OKE BYOL

1. In OCI Console, click **Hamburger menu** -> **Marketplace** -> **All Applications**.
    ![menu marketplace](images/menu-marketplace.png)

2. Type **WebLogic OKE** in the search box and then click **Oracle WebLogic Suite for OKE BYOL**.
    ![menu stack](images/menu-stack.png)

3.  Select the latest version available and choose your compartment and check the box for accepting the terms and condition. Click **Launch Stack**.
    ![launch stack](images/launch-stack.png)

4. In Stack information section, leave everything default and click **Next**.
    ![stack info](images/stack-info.png)

5. Enter **wko** as Resource Name Prefix and Click Browse to choose the SSH Public key.
    ![prefix-ssh](images/prefix-ssh.png)

    > Make sure you use **wko** as prefix, as we will use this in further labs.

6. In Verrazzano Integration, leave default unchecked box for **Enable Verrazzano**.

    **Kubernetes version:** - Leave the default **v1.26.2**.

    **Non-WebLogic Node Pool Shape (Required)** - Select **VM.Standard.E4.Flex** as shape and chooke **1** as Number of OCPU and **16** as Amount of Memory.

    **Node in the NodePool for non-WebLogic pods** - Leave the default **1**.

    ![non weblogic](images/non-weblogic.png)

    **Create WebLogic Node Pool Shape** - Leave the default box as checked.

    **WebLogic Node Pool Shape (Required)** - Select **VM.Standard.E4.Flex** as shape and chooke **1** as Number of OCPU and **16** as Amount of Memory.

    **Node in the NodePool for WebLogic pods** - Leave the default **1**.

9. In Administration Instances, Enter or select the following as shown.
    **Availability Domain for compute instances** - Select the availability domain from the drop down.

    **Administration Instance Compute Shape (Required)**- Select **VM.Standard.E4.Flex** as shape and chooke **1** as Number of OCPU and **16** as Amount of Memory.

    > This will create a Job, which will create the required resources in the stack. You dont need to wait, please proceed to next task,

## Task 4: Access the Graphical Remote Desktop

For ease of execution of this workshop, your VM instance has been pre-configured with a remote graphical desktop accessible using any modern browser on your laptop or workstation. Proceed as detailed below to log in.

1. Open up the hamburger menu in the top left corner. Click **Developer Services**, and choose **Resource Manager** > **Stacks**.

2. Click on the stack name which you have createed in lab 1.
    ![click stack](images/click-stack.png)

3. Navigate to **Application Information** tab, and copy **Remote Desktop URL** and paste it in new browser tab.
    ![desktop url](images/desktop-url.png)
    
    > Now you need to follow all the instruction inside this remote desktop.

You may now proceed to the next lab.
